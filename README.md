# Project Auth API

This is a fullstack project where we have first build a backend API in mongoDB and mongoose with authentication, GET and POST endpoints followed by deployed in google cloud. We have also build and connteced a frontend to this project. 

## The problem

First we started to go thru the material we had an live session about how to build authentication with mongoDB. After we started to plann our project and pair programming. 
We used google, stackoverflow, course material and youtube to finish this project.
